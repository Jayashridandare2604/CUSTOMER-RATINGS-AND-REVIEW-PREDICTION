I won't compare it with windows laptops as we all are aware of it. This is more about M1 chip. People are worried about buying M1 version because of compatibility issues.
Don't worry, this processor is so powerful and in terms of compatibility, this ...",4
1,"Fantastic value for money machine!! Absolute beast as far as sheer performance is concerned that being super efficient on the battery.
1. Using it mainly for coding purposes, browsing and all that regular stuff. Haven‚Äôt played any games on it so I can‚Äôt comment on battery life and performance while gaming but with regular coding stuff like web development, mobile app development, web browsing etc the battery will easily last for 10+ hrs or even more.

Pros-
Blazing fast- M1 is so ahead in performance
Battery is amazing (I use it entire day for work)
Build quality is top notch undoubtedly

Cons-
Webcam is grainy (no update has been able to fix it)- Not a major concern but for the price you pay it is indeed expected.
Color- I opted for Gold (after seeing all the images online), however it has a rose tint and looks pinkish in indoor lights. Its not gold-gold, its pinkish-gold.

First of all, I Thank Flipkart for the fast delivery, that too a day before the promised delivery date.
This is by far the best laptop you could get for the price range. As a person who have been a windows user all my life, MacOS is a totally different experience for me. The aluminium build, the performance, the display and the compactness of this machine has surprised me.

PROS:
1. Everything except it's CONS :p

CONS:
1. Display is little small but it's good resolution kinda make up for it. Also no OLED.
2. MacOS has some wierd quirks. Windows users like me will face some difficulty at first.
3. 30W charger maybe slow for some.
4. You will crave for the glowing logo but it's not there.
5. Soldered 256gig SSD.
6. Apple Repairs are obviously expensive.

I've heard that this laptop heats up really quickly, but I didn't felt any thing like that. This laptop never reaches more than 10 degrees above my room temperature, even after I game on it for 4 hours. This can run mostly all games on high setting with 60 fps. I personally have tried 2 games on it valorant and apex legends both runs on high setting with 60 fps. And even this gives me 60 fps with high settings while recording in Valor...",5
631,"So basically, laptop is well and good. But the huge and huge and huge problem is battery. Battery is drains so fast that you can't imagine, and trust me those who personally use this laptop can say same, and second worst part about this laptop is it's speakers, seriously your mobile phone can play better sound than this laptop.

Pros -
1. Laptop performance is good (4.5)
2. Laptop display is just ok (4)

637,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine.

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

2459,It's a beast laptop but only 1 thing I don't like is in keyboard center it gets hot n left n right side will be cool. While continues playing slowly the hotness spreads to left or right. But except hot . It's best for 12 hours gaming + steaming live.,5

Using battery saving mode, one can easily get 4hrs of battery backup.

2464,"Great laptop except for a few flaws-Charging port is surprisingly difficult to insert the cable into due to a key like shape-needs to be inserted at a specific angle.

Colour scheme is definitely on the duller side, which is good for indoor folks like me but for people prefering bright colours, this might be a problem.

The cooling fan is quite loud but does its job well.

IOS is still a little behind Android in terms of features and shortcuts in my opinion but it‚Äôs very close. Still getting used to all the features of iOS. Per-ordered on the launch day and it arrived barely on time. Overall happy with the purchase.",5
3153,Wonderful,5
3154,Providing review after 1 month of use .. no doubt it‚Äôs a good mobile handling is very smooth n performance is very good as well front camera is descent back camera is awesome with a nice detailing‚Ä¶ cons battery life is not very long proper use of phone may need charging once in every 10 hours ‚Ä¶ if you lay down and try to open the phone by face recognition then it doesn‚Äôt work .. you need to hold the phone flat parallel to your bed then it opens up.,4
3155,Good one...but very tough to switch from Android...,5
3156,Phone is handy and Performs will in high end task.,4
3157,Excellent phone... And flipkart delivered it perfectly the packaging was very nice and was properly sealed and product was 100% genuine...,5
3158,Battery is typically like a 4000mah device uses with two sims. ( assuming u use iphone 12 with one sim with location wifi etc off). For office type use its no issue. Field work types people will want more battery for sure. Cameras are good. Apps aren‚Äôt bulletproof as they claim. Ola app has bugs. Doesn‚Äôt hang. But its still not as fast fluid as one plus. Its not slow mind it. But the buttery transitions on ios make it relatively slow. Speakers have bass sorta.,4
3159,"Phone is fantastic
Only issue is with the display ,
It has yellow tint to it
It‚Äôs not pure white",4

3166,awesome product,5
3167,Very good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,5
3168,Iphone 12 is just love. I switched from iphone 7 to iphone 12 and this phone has hell lot of features. Looks are classy and elegant. Camera quality is amazing not doubt samsung s21ultra have better zoom camera than this but the feel you get while having a iphone and colors generated by its camera processor have no comparison. Little bit costly but when people praises its display and camera quality every penny spent on this feels justifiable.,5

Cameras are excellent but not as sharp as newer android phones with bigger megapixels. But the quality and color accuracy of pictures are great.

4863,"Good one
Best for beginner photographs
Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky.
So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.",5
4864,"Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month.
I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode",5
4865,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .,5
4866,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.,5

4869,"The product is very good
But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens
Then it's amazing so take it for photography
And it's best for beginners",4
4870,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr,4
4871,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm.
Thanks",4

I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck.
I'll make sure not to order anything .

And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.",4

Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue.

The sound system is the strong point, it is distinctly clear. Rightly it was highlighted in the specification and even the label on the TV tells how important it is.
The price at which it was offered made it look like a loot. The TV is a right choice for those who are looking for a compact and affordable yet performing android TV",2

6506,Picture quality is fine. But Audio quality is not good. There is no Equalizer settings. No clarity of picture and sound with SD set top box. Only HD set top box is preferred.

Connectivity and very good and there is no lags. But Realme doesnot meet that. Need more improvements.,3

Here are my observations.
What I liked :
===========

Bezel less
What might have been better:
=======================
Internal storage is too less

Could have given better start up time
Issues observed:

Apps not connecting to internet if we start an app immediately after startup try again option also not working .
There are 2 solutions to this ...",4

Display: Good quality display, good brightness, HDR quality with MEMC technology is an added advantage
Sound: You cannot get better speakers at this price range

Things that need improvement:
Need to include a 3.5 mm audio jack

One thing that needs to be highlighted, whenever we play a video in any app and change the volume or go to ""more options"", the video skips a second, if this can be addressed through a software update then the TV will be 5 on 5",4

Superb product, amazing pictures quality
Now we are having 5 thomson tv at home ranges from 43 to 55 inches. Replaced samsung and one plus with Thomson oath pro and oath pro Max series

Amazing sound and picture quality",5
7791,"Ofcourse in this range you won't get the ""best"" picture quality. The best part of these 43 incher 4ks is HD content looks better than let's say a 55inch 4k. Coming to this TV, the brightness is okay. HDR performance is okay. But I can say say so because i have other 800 nits premium TVs to compare with. In this price range i don't think you can go wrong with this one though.",5

7793,Very bad experience with in few month screen started flickering recommend not to buy this tv,1
7794,The product is waste with absolutely poor service. Since we bought from flipkart the shop or seller also can‚Äôt be held responsible. Product became defective on 20th day. Replaced after 10 weeks of follow up. Replaced item was not new but repaired item. Again the product has connectivity issues. Worst customer service. Won‚Äôt even register a complaint. Bad experience both with flipkart and Thomson is worst,1
7795,I have received totally 3 tvs (ordered 1 tv only) but 3rd tv only now installed because another 2 tvs had a display panel problem. So I have returned 2 times and 3rd time only I got the good product. So this a bad experience with Flip kart. But I don't know whether the problem belongs to Thomson or Flipkart,5
7796,"USB not working...no AUX port, 4k is just a word picture clarity is dull. Sound is not at all satisfactory. I had to buy an extra soundbar. Waste of money. Connectivity is not good too. Please don't waste money on this TV.",1

Cons
Picture quality average. Blur and looks like 3rd class display. Even crt tv has better display. I recommand lg or samsung.
You can't cast your mobile. It is very difficult to connect. There is no screen cast option in tv.
If anyhow you cast your screen then it lags very much.
Tv hangs frequently.

Installation is not free. Technician takes 400 rs for installation but other companies take no charges.

I have returned this led tv.

11009,Review after one week of usage . I am getting a battery backup of 7-8hours a day. Bass is not that much good but still its nice. Only you have to do is adjust the equilizer in your phone for better bass and quality sound. It has a good latency and best for gaming like Pubg. I was about to buy oneplus bulletz but it has a lower bass than 255pro. Charge for atleast 1.5 to 2 hours after delivery for the first time for best battery backup.,5

11094,"After using seven days I wana give honest review.

One of all design and sound quality is too good

Ear doesn't pain if you listen for more then 3 hours also.

Fast charging option available

Doesn't connect to laptop that the biggest - point.

Cons

Battery life is not good as expected

Once battery reach to 40% system will give you voice alert 3 times that battery is low which is irritate me.

I brought at INR.1250 so I cannot keep huge expectations at less price but overall for movie ...",3
11095,"This product is very very good, its sound is amazing and base is also very good ,battery backup is good as i have used for 3 hours and its battery still 70% remaining.

These earphones are no 1",4
11096,After using for two weeks.. Amazing bass amazing battery backup as well as splash proof. Very good built quality,5
11097,"Sound is amazing .but not 4 soft music lover
Voice is clear as it has noise cancellation
Used good material if ur wear for hours on ur neck u will not feel itchy or bulky
Not showing battery percentage properly but charging is fast so need to worry",5

I am simply giving 5 star rating, it exceeds my expectations, those who is thinking to get something in affordable range,this airdopes are made for them only üëç .I ordered this on first sale , though I wanted to order Black color, but black was out of stock so I have to order this color which looks elegant as well.

After using for a day I am writing this, this is worth to buy , don't think too much just go for it, according to price nothing is com...",5
11375,Nice colour nd too cute sound quality is good hope it works well,5
11376,Satisfying . Received today morning. Continuously using this earpods for 3 hrs and still battery is at 90% . So all good. Base can be better but good at this price. Good at calling also. I can hear voice while riding and that's really good. Overall worth buying.,5
11377,"And yes there you go...You have the best in-budget tws....
First of all, let me get something straight- It has amazing sound quality
A decent bass
A nice battery backup
But it lacks only in built design. Yes these are not much comfortable for long durations.
My verdict:- If you are a comfort lover then these are not meant for you.
You should then go for some tws with vacuum grip.
Edit:- Since I'm now used to it, it seems very comfortable to me...
Just go for it",5
11378,"Very good option at this price
Pros: Build quality, clear sound, Lightweight, branded product at low price, perfect fitting, insta wake up technology Good bass and sound(by using other music players mentioned below)
Cons: Low bass which can control by other music players like Google play music, Dub music player or third party equaliser app. You will get perfect sound by playing music on this players.",4
11379,"Everything is fine, just need improve the bass, and one thing many users have said does not work one side, tell them u reset once and then both will work, the battery is very good and excellent performance but many people will have a slight pain in the ear while using it first time, but will not do it when they get used to it after a few days, in the last I will just say that u will not get any good from it at such a low price, THANKS boAt INDIA & THANKS Flipkartüòçüòç",5

11386,"Ok
Updated after long term use. Don't buy if you want to use for long time.
Sound volume is low but clear. Bass is there but not best as these are not in-ear type. Call quality is ok. And battery lasts 3.5 hrs. Good thing is type-C I can use my OnePlus charger with it. Comfortable for long hours.
Dont expect too much from the product at this price. I would say if you don't want to spend much then get this. And obviously if your priority is sound quality then Sony and Bose are only option.",3

I must say at this price point the product is quite good.

Good sound quality, good hardware, comfortable to ears & one part I liked is that it has C type charging port.

Just one thing is missing which is mentioned on the box of product - Additional earmuffs for which I will be writing to Flipkart.

The design though is not upto the mark you cannot wear it for prolonged hours as it gets uncomfortable. The microphone is ok calling experience is ok not that great. Battery backups i cannot comment on that as I haven‚Äôt used it a lot. But for the price that you are paying ,this thing is totally worth the buy.",4

Its just the product quality should have been a bit more high because it will get scratches on the go.. One thing is that you cannot hold it for longer as the ear start paining. short duration is ok to use. I already owe One plus z buds , those are really very comfy.

11437,"It's a nice product in this price range, but I would say a few points which boat needs to work on:
1. boat should manufacture protective covers for the outer case, as I feel that it's really fragile and I'm unable to find some cover.
2. It would be really good if they would have added touch controls in it.
3. The blue led which flashes in every 5 second should be turned off. It gives a really cheap look.",5

Not a good experience. Earbud without this cover is firstly exposed and not so appealing anymore.",3
11444,This pair of headset is perfectly fine and worth every penny. The sound quality is absolutely clear with defined bass. Mic works perfectly fine.

The sound quality it good too, if you are looking for high bass, then don't go for it.
It doesn't hurt the ears after using it for long.
Color is also cute.

11483,"Overall A Very Good Product on Budget
Sound Quality could be a little more better but can't complain much for a budget device like this. Very easy to pair and setup and excellent battery life. As all always after sale service by Boat is EXCELLENT.",4
11484,"Some of the reviews here are overrated.

- The battery backup is really nice.
- No compatibility problems, however it doesn't support AAC sound attributes in some devices.
- One of my Pods has excellent bass, the other one's okay.
- Mono pod feature works well
- You can't control the volume with these, it has to be controlled by device you're connected to.

Probably the best you can get for 1300 INR",4
11485,Excellent worth of money good sound quality and good battery backup also and very comfortable,5
11486,"Sound clarity is really awesome and there could be very few songs which you may be able to hear in full volume. The quality of the case(airdope charger)seems slightly inferior. Overall great value for money. Since I have just purchased the product, will not be able to comment on battery backup and recharging convenience.",5
11487,"Pros:
1. Premium look
2. Comparatively cheap
3. Good battery backup

Cons:
1. Design is such, that initially it will make your ears pain
2. After few months connectivity will slow down
3. Charging of the one ear bud stopped after 4-5 months


Overall one can give this product a try, but there is no guarantee that the unit purchased will last long without any fault.

Not very satisfied with the product.",3

Good design and ergonomic fit.
Good battery back up.

I was a user of apple earpods. But when I suddenly switched to this, it was hard for me to get adjusted with the new sound stage. I was disappointed . But things got superb when I became used to it. I understood to tune the earphone accordingly to get the best sounding.
It's bass is so powerful, and mids and highs are good, but slightly overpowered by thumping bass. I must say, bass is so much more that even apple earpods.
Instrument seperation is somewhat poor.

pros
7-8 hrs of battery life (including 45 mins approx call time)
Awesome sound output.
Bass and treble are really very clear without equaliser. With equaliser, sound wary depends on the handset sound quality.
Weightless to carry and in head too
Mic is good, but in traffic it is not too good (3.25/5)
3.5mm Option is really important to mention. Really expecting other leading brands to implement this.

Cons
Very tight in ears. adjusters are ok .. this ll be very tight...",4

The cable of 3.5 jack is a disaster. Mic doesnt even work when you connect with laptop cos the cable has 2 rings. You need 3 rings for mic to work.
Headset is ok ok in terms of music.
Connectivity is poor. I dont even recommend this product now...",2

This is going to be a long term review, when i was buying this i have boat 450 in my mind too but somewhere i research both and found boat 450 is not durable and gets brick from its joints and also 450 have very heavy bass which kills mids and highs sometimes,
For example in pubg if you using m762 and when you spray you will not able to hear anything else because of that heavy bass in boat 450.
Now coming to boat 4...",5
14192,The product is really a good product in this price range. I used it for last one week and i think it gives more than 8 hours battery backup. Its base is very good but overall sound is good.

14233,It is too tight and paining with in 20min of usage. Compatability with mobile phones is not that good. I tried with Zenfone Pro M1 and Honor View 10 mobiles. volume up and down buttons not working as expected. Those buttons are always changing songs. Call clarity is actually worst. I tried in almost 10 different devices. Voice always get disconnected. Only good point I see is audio quality and bass is good while listening songs.,1

14239,its very good for 30 minutes to 1 hour usage.. ear cup is small along with a small frame so it gives high pressure on the ear. its over the ear headphone as described but i didn't expect it going to be so uncomfortable. AND NO REFUND .bass is too much so u miss the other instruments . build quality is ok because its a simple design where the ear cups are fixed on 2 steel rods. so i hope it should last.soud quality is good. superb alternate is the iball headset,1

SOUND QUALITY
it have a good sound quality but a great bass. Even at maximum volume headphone starts vibrating and your ears vibrates too. But as due to good bass effect, those other sweet tones are supressed.

14395,"i bought these headphones from Flipkart sale of January for Rs. 999. Being a student, it was my first priority to buy headphones that are wireless and sounds decent. Boat headphones provided both of these features at an affordable price. After 1 month of usage, I am sharing my unbiased review of this product in the form of pros and cons.
PROS:
1. Great wireless headphones in affordable price range.
2. Decent sound and similarly decent bass. not too high, not flat either.
3. I saw some reviews...",4

14397,sound quality is very awesome & bass is unbelievable as compare to other. It also very pretty in looking. Only giving 4 star because of it excessive bass and little uncomfortable design. continue using it 2 hours it become little uncomfortable . its noise cancellation is quiet good in this price segment . All - over who is keen lover of listening song it is the better choise .,4

2.Bluetooth range is not expected as much .

6.better for using in aux cable.",4
14400,"These are the best ones out there.

One of the cool features is that it has a cable connection as an option. Handy when device runs out of battery.

The voice guidance is another cool it's your in this.

Guys blindly go for this, I got everything you need and it's worth every penny you have paid for.

The sound is also the best in the class. You will be spending hours and I am sure that you won't be finding a better 1 in this price range.",5
14401,"Nice one. I am writing this review after a use of 4 months. I didn't get any problem till date with this headphone. I will definitely recommend everyone to buy this. I had bought this at a very cheaper price of 1249 only thorough the flipkart itself.

14402,"Satisfied with these headphones.
@Quality
To tell actually this headphones are base centric, mids and highs lack a bit. If you regularly listen to silent Bollywood songs this should not be your choice but EDM lover can surely purchase best for that.
@Comfort
The foam of the earpiece are soft but if you have ears a bit larger then this may hurt you.
You can not wear thse for more than 1 hr

Rest no issue range pretty good.Till 16 feet is seem less experience , after than a bit loss of soun...",5

14406,"Great Headset. It has a fantastic bass, the wireless capability is good and the battery backup is simply superb. But if you are using it call please avoid it because the inbuilt mic is bad.

Overall its a great Headphone.",4
14407,Awesome bass... Awesome sound... Very comfortable to my ears... But there was a problem... The Bluetooth connection weakens frequently and you will get a jump through the lyrics for a sec while listening to songs... This you can avoid...

And ordered boats wireless 600 ... Let's see how this one goes...,4
14408,Hi guys I recently brought these headphone and have been using it for a while now. The headphones are just decent for the price range. I got it for under 1000 bucks. The optimal sound can be achieved through equilizer only. Pairing it is fairly easy. Battery is also decent. The ear puffs are not too comfortable. A little bigger and softer puffs would have been great. The build quality is also fairly decent. The only issue I faced was with the microphone. Others were not able to hear me proper...,3
14409,"This is what I wanted. I got it @INR 999. I am seriously loving this product. boAt team you have done exceptionally well. The thump it provides in Stellio along with the bass is the one to listen for. I highly recommend this product. Kudos team boAt!

repeated review:
deducted 2 stars for the pain it causes on my ear. A type of headache on listening for only 15 mins.
Guys you need to work on the structure and comfort of the headphones.
Hope I didn't get rude!",3
14410,Just awesome. I will highly recommend this one. I have used JBL and SONY but this one is far better than those. You can't find a better wireless headphone with in 5K. Bass and sound clarity is just awesome. You will be amazed if u play with wire.,5
14411,"according to its price it is a good product

With stunning detaails of music",1

When the battery is about to die, the number of times it notifies gets irritating, so you won't be able to listen to anything except the notification of the battery being low.

Whenever i watch a video the sound goes mute and i have to rewind the video to unmute it. It gives an extra wire for the headphone along with the usb. Design is rocking and well built. Keys are okay but can be improved a little bit. And battery life is good but it starts draining frequently after a little long use.,4

16191,"Though the watch is of very good quality, it does not matches with all the features as advertised such as fully waterproof. It is only splash proof & dust proof. They don't recommend it wearing while swimming or bathing. (It is written in the manual booklet).
Otherwise, the watch is good in every aspects. It comes with pre-applied screen guard.",3
16192,"""Amazing product by FireBoltt !
Fire-Boltt Talk is the coolest gadget i hav so far. Its easy to make calls, and answer calls. Its easy to connect ur watch and other features such as spo2, bp, heartbeat monitor wrk fyn. I Recommend it all.
But dont forget to remove the protective screen.""",5

Received product today . Thanks Flipkart for fast delivery.
I think this is the first review of this product.
Good in all aspects. Good in looks, design, display and performance",5
16194,Good in style... features are all good .. speaker is very loud n clear .. battery backup with all functions come in end within 36 hours backup..over all good in this price range,4
16195,The product is good for day to day activity. I am satisfied with the product. It's the best value for money product in this price range. I will suggest you use the mobile app for better performance.,5
16196,I have got this watch and found that the watch is loaded with all features which generally have in high end smart watches. The best feature I liked is dial pad. Value for money,5
16197,This is just a digital watch with smart appearance. Sleep tracking is improper. Step counter shows too much number. So finally I am not happy with this watch. Specifications are very impressive but doesn't work as such.,3

16200,"Perfect one in the budget. Bluetooth calling is working perfectly. Lots of watch faces. All the health data are mostly accurate. The watch should be tight on your wrist to get the accurate readings. Otherwise you have to press and hold the watch during measurements. Battery backup is good. The sleep monitor is pretty awesome! We cannot cheat the watch by pretending we are sleeping. It record the exact time when we fall asleep and when we awake. Good build quality.

16202,Decent watch at this price range. The Bluetooth calling works fine. Gives an option of saving upto 8 contacts at a time. Tracking features incl heart rate and SPO 2 are fairly ok. Continuous step tracking is not so reliable.,4
